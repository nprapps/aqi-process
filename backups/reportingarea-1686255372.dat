Concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) are expected to rise overnight tonight as a plume of wildfire smoke enters the region.  *** Friday’s Forecast:  An area of low pressure continues to spin over New England to bring smoke from wildfires across Quebec southward into the region.  The smoke models for a few days now have been showing a plume of smoke crossing Lake Erie into western Pennsylvania late in the day on Thursday.  Observations where the same models had the plume’s location for Thursday afternoon are not seeing a significant rise in hourly concentrations as the plume passes by.  This may be due to this plume moving through an area with good afternoon mixing.  The observed values in the region just to the north of Lake Erie may not fully represent the kind of hourly concentrations western Pennsylvania will see during the overnight hours into Friday morning.  This will be due to lower mixing heights and lighter winds during the overnight to morning hours with temperatures also cooling overnight to create more stable conditions.  Overnight and early morning concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) are expected to reach Code ORANGE to Code RED levels on an hourly basis when this new plume combines with the existing smoke that is blanketing the region and will mix out some during the afternoon on Friday.  Concentrations of PM-2.5 are expected to be in the Code ORANGE range on average for the full day.  With a mix of sun and clouds ozone concentrations will be limited to the good range.  *** Extended Outlook:  The area of low pressure that has been the source of driving wildfire smoke southward to create our regional air quality issues will finally begin to depart the region by Saturday.  The wind flow will become more westerly.  Conditions will be monitored to see how much is able to be cleared out of the region.  Lingering smoke will allow for moderate air quality for the day.  Increasing sunshine by Sunday may allow ozone concentrations to rise as the smoke departs so that will be monitored as well.  --- Roble|Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection

CLAIR, WAYNE  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Canadian wildfire smoke continues to drift into our area due to the NNE winds currently in place. The Ontario fires, which are directly impacting us, do not seem to be letting up as we are researching to see the containment of them. The current weather pattern appears to remain in place until at least tomorrow morning when the High-pressure system is expected to drift more south. This will open the door for a Low-pressure and associated cold front to approach the region Saturday afternoon and into Sunday. When this change in weather patterns occurs, we are expecting to see a shift in winds which will be more NNW instead of the current NNE which is bringing the smoke right towards us. But for the next day, we are still expecting PM-2.5 concentrations to exceed the USG range and into the Unhealthy range. We have noticed that these smoke plumes are coming in waves. This explains why for some hours we are seeing USG/Unhealthy PM-2.5 concentrations and for other hours we are seeing Moderate concentrations. But nonetheless, overall PM-2.5 concentrations will be in the USG to Unhealthy range until at least tomorrow, Friday, which is why this forecast will be updated tomorrow morning.

||06/08/23|06/09/23||EDT|1|F|N|Ann Arbor|MI|42.2754|-83.7308|OZONE||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Thursday June 8th, 2023, through Friday June 9th, 2023  PM-2.5: PM-2.5 concentrations will be in the USG range with some hourly concentrations in the Unhealthy range.   OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to Moderate range.   …AIR QUALITY ACTION DAY ADVISORY FOR THURSDAY JUNE 8TH AND FRIDAY JUNE 9TH UNTIL NOON  THE ACTION DAY ADVISORY INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING SOUTHERN MICHIGAN COUNTIES:  LAKE, MASON, NEWAYGO, OCEANA, ALLEGAN, KENT, MUSKEGON, OTTAWA, BRANCH, CALHOUN, KALAMAZOO, ST.JOSEPH, BERRIEN, CASS, VAN BUREN, BARRY, CLARE, CLINTON, EATON, GRATIOT, INGHAM, IONIA, ISABELLA, MECOSTA, MONTCALM, OSCEOLA, ARENAC, BAY, GLADWIN, HURON, MIDLAND, SAGINAW, SANILAC, TUSCOLA, GENESEE, LAPEER, SHIAWASSEE, HILLSDALE, JACKSON, LENAWEE, LIVINGSTON, WASHTENAW, MACOMB, MONROE, OAKLAND, ST. CLAIR, WAYNE  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Canadian wildfire smoke continues to drift into our area due to the NNE winds currently in place. The Ontario fires, which are directly impacting us, do not seem to be letting up as we are researching to see the containment of them. The current weather pattern appears to remain in place until at least tomorrow morning when the High-pressure system is expected to drift more south. This will open the door for a Low-pressure and associated cold front to approach the region Saturday afternoon and into Sunday. When this change in weather patterns occurs, we are expecting to see a shift in winds which will be more NNW instead of the current NNE which is bringing the smoke right towards us. But for the next day, we are still expecting PM-2.5 concentrations to exceed the USG range and into the Unhealthy range. We have noticed that these smoke plumes are coming in waves. This explains why for some hours we are seeing USG/Unhealthy PM-2.5 concentrations and for other hours we are seeing Moderate concentrations. But nonetheless, overall PM-2.5 concentrations will be in the USG to Unhealthy range until at least tomorrow, Friday, which is why this forecast will be updated tomorrow morning.   EXTENDED FORECAST: Wildfire smoke looks to persist for the coming days, so overall air quality will remain poor.

Once this system fades away tomorrow, another trough is expected to approach California this weekend and continue the below-normal temperature trend.  Hidden Valley saw more PM10 spikes this morning from the light SE winds which transported the dust pollution from the nearby activities and is forecasted to reach the upper-Moderate AQI today.  For other sites, the PM10 is forecasted to remain in the Good before the next trough comes by with more winds.  Since there are multiple troughs located in California, the winds are expected to continue blowing SW which will keep the ozone levels low. However, we are experiencing a gap between two troughs with lighter westerly winds today and tomorrow, so the ozone has the potential to rise toward the upper-Moderate AQI.

For other sites, the PM10 is forecasted to remain in the Good before the next trough comes by with more winds.  Since there are multiple troughs located in California, the winds are expected to continue blowing SW which will keep the ozone levels low. However, we are experiencing a gap between two troughs with lighter westerly winds today and tomorrow, so the ozone has the potential to rise toward the upper-Moderate AQI.  The strong winds will return this weekend and might see more Good days.  Stay tuned and check back tomorrow for an updated air quality forecast.|Pinal County Air Quality Control District

OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to Moderate range.   …AIR QUALITY ACTION DAY ADVISORY FOR THURSDAY JUNE 8TH AND FRIDAY JUNE 9TH UNTIL NOON  THE ACTION DAY ADVISORY INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING SOUTHERN MICHIGAN COUNTIES:  LAKE, MASON, NEWAYGO, OCEANA, ALLEGAN, KENT, MUSKEGON, OTTAWA, BRANCH, CALHOUN, KALAMAZOO, ST.JOSEPH, BERRIEN, CASS, VAN BUREN, BARRY, CLARE, CLINTON, EATON, GRATIOT, INGHAM, IONIA, ISABELLA, MECOSTA, MONTCALM, OSCEOLA, ARENAC, BAY, GLADWIN, HURON, MIDLAND, SAGINAW, SANILAC, TUSCOLA, GENESEE, LAPEER, SHIAWASSEE, HILLSDALE, JACKSON, LENAWEE, LIVINGSTON, WASHTENAW, MACOMB, MONROE, OAKLAND, ST. CLAIR, WAYNE  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Canadian wildfire smoke continues to drift into our area due to the NNE winds currently in place. The Ontario fires, which are directly impacting us, do not seem to be letting up as we are researching to see the containment of them. The current weather pattern appears to remain in place until at least tomorrow morning when the High-pressure system is expected to drift more south. This will open the door for a Low-pressure and associated cold front to approach the region Saturday afternoon and into Sunday. When this change in weather patterns occurs, we are expecting to see a shift in winds which will be more NNW instead of the current NNE which is bringing the smoke right towards us. But for the next day, we are still expecting PM-2.5 concentrations to exceed the USG range and into the Unhealthy range. We have noticed that these smoke plumes are coming in waves. This explains why for some hours we are seeing USG/Unhealthy PM-2.5 concentrations and for other hours we are seeing Moderate concentrations. But nonetheless, overall PM-2.5 concentrations will be in the USG to Unhealthy range until at least tomorrow, Friday, which is why this forecast will be updated tomorrow morning.

Once this system fades away tomorrow, another trough is expected to approach California this weekend and continue the below-normal temperature trend.  Hidden Valley saw more PM10 spikes this morning from the light SE winds which transported the dust pollution from the nearby activities and is forecasted to reach the upper-Moderate AQI today.  For other sites, the PM10 is forecasted to remain in the Good before the next trough comes by with more winds.  Since there are multiple troughs located in California, the winds are expected to continue blowing SW which will keep the ozone levels low. However, we are experiencing a gap between two troughs with lighter westerly winds today and tomorrow, so the ozone has the potential to rise toward the upper-Moderate AQI.

Levels of fine particulates will remain in the unhealthy category statewide on Thursday and extend into the evening hours due to wildfire smoke transport from eastern Canadian wildfires. Some members of the general public may experience health effects, while members of sensitive groups, including those with heart or lung disease, the elderly, and the young, may experience more serious health effects. All individuals should limit strenuous activities and the amount of time active outdoors especially in the evening hours. In addition, ozone is forecast to reach the low moderate category as sunny skies, light winds, and warm temperatures are forecast for the Garden State.  6/9 - An Air Quality Action Day for Particulate Matter (PM2.5) has been declared for Friday, June 9th. Sensitive individuals, including those with heart or lung disease, the elderly, and the young should limit strenuous activities and the amount of time active outdoors. Levels of fine particulates will remain elevated in the unhealthy for sensitive groups category statewide on Friday due to residual Canadian wildfire smoke. Ozone levels are forecast to drop into the good/moderate threshold on Friday as chances for rain are expected to help limit ozone formation in northern portions of the state.|New Jersey Dept. of Environmental Protection

Once this system fades away tomorrow, another trough is expected to approach California this weekend and continue the below-normal temperature trend.  Hidden Valley saw more PM10 spikes this morning from the light SE winds which transported the dust pollution from the nearby activities and is forecasted to reach the upper-Moderate AQI today.  For other sites, the PM10 is forecasted to remain in the Good before the next trough comes by with more winds.  Since there are multiple troughs located in California, the winds are expected to continue blowing SW which will keep the ozone levels low. However, we are experiencing a gap between two troughs with lighter westerly winds today and tomorrow, so the ozone has the potential to rise toward the upper-Moderate AQI.  The strong winds will return this weekend and might see more Good days.  Stay tuned and check back tomorrow for an updated air quality forecast.|Pinal County Air Quality Control District

Since there are multiple troughs located in California, the winds are expected to continue blowing SW which will keep the ozone levels low. However, we are experiencing a gap between two troughs with lighter westerly winds today and tomorrow, so the ozone has the potential to rise toward the upper-Moderate AQI.  The strong winds will return this weekend and might see more Good days.  Stay tuned and check back tomorrow for an updated air quality forecast.|Pinal County Air Quality Control District

Saturday, light westerly winds will continue to transport smoke away from the Columbus region. However, mostly sunny skies and temperatures in the 80s will increase ozone production, keeping AQI levels high-Moderate. Sunday, as a low pressure system approaches central Ohio, periods of southerly to easterly winds will aid dispersion and mixing. However, these winds will transport smoke and other pollutants into the Columbus region, leading to Moderate AQI levels. Monday, as the low pressure system moves through central Ohio, moderate westerly winds will develop, dispersing pollutants and bringing cleaner air into the area. Therefore, AQI levels will be low-Moderate. Tuesday, moderate westerly winds will continue to enhance pollutant dispersion. However, these winds will also gradually transport another plume of smoke into the Columbus region, increasing particle concentrations in the afternoon. As a result, AQI levels will be Moderate.|MORPC

Levels of fine particulates will remain in the unhealthy category statewide on Thursday and extend into the evening hours due to wildfire smoke transport from eastern Canadian wildfires. Some members of the general public may experience health effects, while members of sensitive groups, including those with heart or lung disease, the elderly, and the young, may experience more serious health effects. All individuals should limit strenuous activities and the amount of time active outdoors especially in the evening hours. In addition, ozone is forecast to reach the low moderate category as sunny skies, light winds, and warm temperatures are forecast for the Garden State.  6/9 - An Air Quality Action Day for Particulate Matter (PM2.5) has been declared for Friday, June 9th. Sensitive individuals, including those with heart or lung disease, the elderly, and the young should limit strenuous activities and the amount of time active outdoors. Levels of fine particulates will remain elevated in the unhealthy for sensitive groups category statewide on Friday due to residual Canadian wildfire smoke. Ozone levels are forecast to drop into the good/moderate threshold on Friday as chances for rain are expected to help limit ozone formation in northern portions of the state.|New Jersey Dept. of Environmental Protection

OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to Moderate range.   …AIR QUALITY ACTION DAY ADVISORY FOR THURSDAY JUNE 8TH AND FRIDAY JUNE 9TH UNTIL NOON  THE ACTION DAY ADVISORY INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING SOUTHERN MICHIGAN COUNTIES:  LAKE, MASON, NEWAYGO, OCEANA, ALLEGAN, KENT, MUSKEGON, OTTAWA, BRANCH, CALHOUN, KALAMAZOO, ST.JOSEPH, BERRIEN, CASS, VAN BUREN, BARRY, CLARE, CLINTON, EATON, GRATIOT, INGHAM, IONIA, ISABELLA, MECOSTA, MONTCALM, OSCEOLA, ARENAC, BAY, GLADWIN, HURON, MIDLAND, SAGINAW, SANILAC, TUSCOLA, GENESEE, LAPEER, SHIAWASSEE, HILLSDALE, JACKSON, LENAWEE, LIVINGSTON, WASHTENAW, MACOMB, MONROE, OAKLAND, ST. CLAIR, WAYNE  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Canadian wildfire smoke continues to drift into our area due to the NNE winds currently in place. The Ontario fires, which are directly impacting us, do not seem to be letting up as we are researching to see the containment of them. The current weather pattern appears to remain in place until at least tomorrow morning when the High-pressure system is expected to drift more south. This will open the door for a Low-pressure and associated cold front to approach the region Saturday afternoon and into Sunday. When this change in weather patterns occurs, we are expecting to see a shift in winds which will be more NNW instead of the current NNE which is bringing the smoke right towards us. But for the next day, we are still expecting PM-2.5 concentrations to exceed the USG range and into the Unhealthy range. We have noticed that these smoke plumes are coming in waves. This explains why for some hours we are seeing USG/Unhealthy PM-2.5 concentrations and for other hours we are seeing Moderate concentrations. But nonetheless, overall PM-2.5 concentrations will be in the USG to Unhealthy range until at least tomorrow, Friday, which is why this forecast will be updated tomorrow morning.

OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to Moderate range.   …AIR QUALITY ACTION DAY ADVISORY FOR THURSDAY JUNE 8TH AND FRIDAY JUNE 9TH UNTIL NOON  THE ACTION DAY ADVISORY INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING SOUTHERN MICHIGAN COUNTIES:  LAKE, MASON, NEWAYGO, OCEANA, ALLEGAN, KENT, MUSKEGON, OTTAWA, BRANCH, CALHOUN, KALAMAZOO, ST.JOSEPH, BERRIEN, CASS, VAN BUREN, BARRY, CLARE, CLINTON, EATON, GRATIOT, INGHAM, IONIA, ISABELLA, MECOSTA, MONTCALM, OSCEOLA, ARENAC, BAY, GLADWIN, HURON, MIDLAND, SAGINAW, SANILAC, TUSCOLA, GENESEE, LAPEER, SHIAWASSEE, HILLSDALE, JACKSON, LENAWEE, LIVINGSTON, WASHTENAW, MACOMB, MONROE, OAKLAND, ST. CLAIR, WAYNE  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Canadian wildfire smoke continues to drift into our area due to the NNE winds currently in place. The Ontario fires, which are directly impacting us, do not seem to be letting up as we are researching to see the containment of them. The current weather pattern appears to remain in place until at least tomorrow morning when the High-pressure system is expected to drift more south. This will open the door for a Low-pressure and associated cold front to approach the region Saturday afternoon and into Sunday. When this change in weather patterns occurs, we are expecting to see a shift in winds which will be more NNW instead of the current NNE which is bringing the smoke right towards us. But for the next day, we are still expecting PM-2.5 concentrations to exceed the USG range and into the Unhealthy range. We have noticed that these smoke plumes are coming in waves. This explains why for some hours we are seeing USG/Unhealthy PM-2.5 concentrations and for other hours we are seeing Moderate concentrations. But nonetheless, overall PM-2.5 concentrations will be in the USG to Unhealthy range until at least tomorrow, Friday, which is why this forecast will be updated tomorrow morning.   EXTENDED FORECAST: Wildfire smoke looks to persist for the coming days, so overall air quality will remain poor.

Furthermore, partly cloudy skies will reduce ozone formation, and moderate onshore winds will enhance dispersion. These conditions will yield Good ozone levels.|Sacramento Metro. AQMD

Concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) are expected to rise overnight tonight as a plume of wildfire smoke enters the region.  *** Friday’s Forecast:  An area of low pressure continues to spin over New England to bring smoke from wildfires across Quebec southward into the region.  The smoke models for a few days now have been showing a plume of smoke crossing Lake Erie into western Pennsylvania late in the day on Thursday.  Observations where the same models had the plume’s location for Thursday afternoon are not seeing a significant rise in hourly concentrations as the plume passes by.  This may be due to this plume moving through an area with good afternoon mixing.  The observed values in the region just to the north of Lake Erie may not fully represent the kind of hourly concentrations western Pennsylvania will see during the overnight hours into Friday morning.  This will be due to lower mixing heights and lighter winds during the overnight to morning hours with temperatures also cooling overnight to create more stable conditions.  Overnight and early morning concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) are expected to reach Code ORANGE to Code RED levels on an hourly basis when this new plume combines with the existing smoke that is blanketing the region and will mix out some during the afternoon on Friday.  Concentrations of PM-2.5 are expected to be in the Code ORANGE range on average for the full day.

Concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) are expected to rise overnight tonight as a plume of wildfire smoke enters the region.  *** Friday’s Forecast:  An area of low pressure continues to spin over New England to bring smoke from wildfires across Quebec southward into the region.  The smoke models for a few days now have been showing a plume of smoke crossing Lake Erie into western Pennsylvania late in the day on Thursday.  Observations where the same models had the plume’s location for Thursday afternoon are not seeing a significant rise in hourly concentrations as the plume passes by.  This may be due to this plume moving through an area with good afternoon mixing.  The observed values in the region just to the north of Lake Erie may not fully represent the kind of hourly concentrations western Pennsylvania will see during the overnight hours into Friday morning.  This will be due to lower mixing heights and lighter winds during the overnight to morning hours with temperatures also cooling overnight to create more stable conditions.  Overnight and early morning concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) are expected to reach Code ORANGE to Code RED levels on an hourly basis when this new plume combines with the existing smoke that is blanketing the region and will mix out some during the afternoon on Friday.

OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to Moderate range.   …AIR QUALITY ACTION DAY ADVISORY FOR THURSDAY JUNE 8TH AND FRIDAY JUNE 9TH UNTIL NOON  THE ACTION DAY ADVISORY INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING SOUTHERN MICHIGAN COUNTIES:  LAKE, MASON, NEWAYGO, OCEANA, ALLEGAN, KENT, MUSKEGON, OTTAWA, BRANCH, CALHOUN, KALAMAZOO, ST.JOSEPH, BERRIEN, CASS, VAN BUREN, BARRY, CLARE, CLINTON, EATON, GRATIOT, INGHAM, IONIA, ISABELLA, MECOSTA, MONTCALM, OSCEOLA, ARENAC, BAY, GLADWIN, HURON, MIDLAND, SAGINAW, SANILAC, TUSCOLA, GENESEE, LAPEER, SHIAWASSEE, HILLSDALE, JACKSON, LENAWEE, LIVINGSTON, WASHTENAW, MACOMB, MONROE, OAKLAND, ST. CLAIR, WAYNE  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Canadian wildfire smoke continues to drift into our area due to the NNE winds currently in place. The Ontario fires, which are directly impacting us, do not seem to be letting up as we are researching to see the containment of them. The current weather pattern appears to remain in place until at least tomorrow morning when the High-pressure system is expected to drift more south. This will open the door for a Low-pressure and associated cold front to approach the region Saturday afternoon and into Sunday. When this change in weather patterns occurs, we are expecting to see a shift in winds which will be more NNW instead of the current NNE which is bringing the smoke right towards us. But for the next day, we are still expecting PM-2.5 concentrations to exceed the USG range and into the Unhealthy range. We have noticed that these smoke plumes are coming in waves. This explains why for some hours we are seeing USG/Unhealthy PM-2.5 concentrations and for other hours we are seeing Moderate concentrations. But nonetheless, overall PM-2.5 concentrations will be in the USG to Unhealthy range until at least tomorrow, Friday, which is why this forecast will be updated tomorrow morning.   EXTENDED FORECAST: Wildfire smoke looks to persist for the coming days, so overall air quality will remain poor.

OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to Moderate range.   …AIR QUALITY ACTION DAY ADVISORY FOR THURSDAY JUNE 8TH AND FRIDAY JUNE 9TH UNTIL NOON  THE ACTION DAY ADVISORY INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING SOUTHERN MICHIGAN COUNTIES:  LAKE, MASON, NEWAYGO, OCEANA, ALLEGAN, KENT, MUSKEGON, OTTAWA, BRANCH, CALHOUN, KALAMAZOO, ST.JOSEPH, BERRIEN, CASS, VAN BUREN, BARRY, CLARE, CLINTON, EATON, GRATIOT, INGHAM, IONIA, ISABELLA, MECOSTA, MONTCALM, OSCEOLA, ARENAC, BAY, GLADWIN, HURON, MIDLAND, SAGINAW, SANILAC, TUSCOLA, GENESEE, LAPEER, SHIAWASSEE, HILLSDALE, JACKSON, LENAWEE, LIVINGSTON, WASHTENAW, MACOMB, MONROE, OAKLAND, ST. CLAIR, WAYNE  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Canadian wildfire smoke continues to drift into our area due to the NNE winds currently in place. The Ontario fires, which are directly impacting us, do not seem to be letting up as we are researching to see the containment of them. The current weather pattern appears to remain in place until at least tomorrow morning when the High-pressure system is expected to drift more south. This will open the door for a Low-pressure and associated cold front to approach the region Saturday afternoon and into Sunday. When this change in weather patterns occurs, we are expecting to see a shift in winds which will be more NNW instead of the current NNE which is bringing the smoke right towards us. But for the next day, we are still expecting PM-2.5 concentrations to exceed the USG range and into the Unhealthy range. We have noticed that these smoke plumes are coming in waves. This explains why for some hours we are seeing USG/Unhealthy PM-2.5 concentrations and for other hours we are seeing Moderate concentrations. But nonetheless, overall PM-2.5 concentrations will be in the USG to Unhealthy range until at least tomorrow, Friday, which is why this forecast will be updated tomorrow morning.   EXTENDED FORECAST: Wildfire smoke looks to persist for the coming days, so overall air quality will remain poor.

When this change in weather patterns occurs, we are expecting to see a shift in winds which will be more NNW instead of the current NNE which is bringing the smoke right towards us. But for the next day, we are still expecting PM-2.5 concentrations to exceed the USG range and into the Unhealthy range. We have noticed that these smoke plumes are coming in waves. This explains why for some hours we are seeing USG/Unhealthy PM-2.5 concentrations and for other hours we are seeing Moderate concentrations. But nonetheless, overall PM-2.5 concentrations will be in the USG to Unhealthy range until at least tomorrow, Friday, which is why this forecast will be updated tomorrow morning.   EXTENDED FORECAST: Wildfire smoke looks to persist for the coming days, so overall air quality will remain poor.

A trough of low pressure aloft and scattered thunderstorms will aid atmospheric mixing and limit ozone development.

A trough of low pressure aloft and scattered thunderstorms will aid atmospheric mixing and limit ozone development. However, west-northwesterly winds will continue to transport smoke from eastern Canadian wildfires into the state, keeping particle levels elevated. These conditions, combined with high pollutant carryover from the previous day, will lead to Unhealthy AQI levels for PM2.5.  Saturday, June 10 is anticipated to be a Code Orange Air Quality Action Day. Calm to light northwesterly winds early in the day will allow smoke to accumulate across the First State. Furthermore, sunny skies and highs in the low-80s will promote ozone development, while smoke will enhance ozone production. Therefore, despite strengthening west-northwesterly afternoon winds aiding dispersion, AQI levels are anticipated to be Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups for PM2.5.   Sunday, light and variable morning winds will allow pollutants to accumulate in Delaware.

Once this system fades away tomorrow, another trough is expected to approach California this weekend and continue the below-normal temperature trend.  Hidden Valley saw more PM10 spikes this morning from the light SE winds which transported the dust pollution from the nearby activities and is forecasted to reach the upper-Moderate AQI today.  For other sites, the PM10 is forecasted to remain in the Good before the next trough comes by with more winds.  Since there are multiple troughs located in California, the winds are expected to continue blowing SW which will keep the ozone levels low. However, we are experiencing a gap between two troughs with lighter westerly winds today and tomorrow, so the ozone has the potential to rise toward the upper-Moderate AQI.  The strong winds will return this weekend and might see more Good days.  Stay tuned and check back tomorrow for an updated air quality forecast.|Pinal County Air Quality Control District

Once this system fades away tomorrow, another trough is expected to approach California this weekend and continue the below-normal temperature trend.  Hidden Valley saw more PM10 spikes this morning from the light SE winds which transported the dust pollution from the nearby activities and is forecasted to reach the upper-Moderate AQI today.  For other sites, the PM10 is forecasted to remain in the Good before the next trough comes by with more winds.  Since there are multiple troughs located in California, the winds are expected to continue blowing SW which will keep the ozone levels low.

CLAIR, WAYNE  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Canadian wildfire smoke continues to drift into our area due to the NNE winds currently in place. The Ontario fires, which are directly impacting us, do not seem to be letting up as we are researching to see the containment of them. The current weather pattern appears to remain in place until at least tomorrow morning when the High-pressure system is expected to drift more south. This will open the door for a Low-pressure and associated cold front to approach the region Saturday afternoon and into Sunday. When this change in weather patterns occurs, we are expecting to see a shift in winds which will be more NNW instead of the current NNE which is bringing the smoke right towards us. But for the next day, we are still expecting PM-2.5 concentrations to exceed the USG range and into the Unhealthy range. We have noticed that these smoke plumes are coming in waves. This explains why for some hours we are seeing USG/Unhealthy PM-2.5 concentrations and for other hours we are seeing Moderate concentrations. But nonetheless, overall PM-2.5 concentrations will be in the USG to Unhealthy range until at least tomorrow, Friday, which is why this forecast will be updated tomorrow morning.   EXTENDED FORECAST: Wildfire smoke looks to persist for the coming days, so overall air quality will remain poor.

Concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) are expected to rise overnight tonight as a plume of wildfire smoke enters the region.  *** Friday’s Forecast:  An area of low pressure continues to spin over New England to bring smoke from wildfires across Quebec southward into the region.  The smoke models for a few days now have been showing a plume of smoke crossing Lake Erie into western Pennsylvania late in the day on Thursday.  Observations where the same models had the plume’s location for Thursday afternoon are not seeing a significant rise in hourly concentrations as the plume passes by.  This may be due to this plume moving through an area with good afternoon mixing.  The observed values in the region just to the north of Lake Erie may not fully represent the kind of hourly concentrations western Pennsylvania will see during the overnight hours into Friday morning.  This will be due to lower mixing heights and lighter winds during the overnight to morning hours with temperatures also cooling overnight to create more stable conditions.  Overnight and early morning concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) are expected to reach Code ORANGE to Code RED levels on an hourly basis when this new plume combines with the existing smoke that is blanketing the region and will mix out some during the afternoon on Friday.  Concentrations of PM-2.5 are expected to be in the Code ORANGE range on average for the full day.  With a mix of sun and clouds ozone concentrations will be limited to the good range.  *** Extended Outlook:  The area of low pressure that has been the source of driving wildfire smoke southward to create our regional air quality issues will finally begin to depart the region by Saturday.  The wind flow will become more westerly.  Conditions will be monitored to see how much is able to be cleared out of the region.  Lingering smoke will allow for moderate air quality for the day.  Increasing sunshine by Sunday may allow ozone concentrations to rise as the smoke departs so that will be monitored as well.  --- Roble|Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection

Concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) are expected to rise overnight tonight as a plume of wildfire smoke enters the region.  *** Friday’s Forecast:  An area of low pressure continues to spin over New England to bring smoke from wildfires across Quebec southward into the region.  The smoke models for a few days now have been showing a plume of smoke crossing Lake Erie into western Pennsylvania late in the day on Thursday.  Observations where the same models had the plume’s location for Thursday afternoon are not seeing a significant rise in hourly concentrations as the plume passes by.  This may be due to this plume moving through an area with good afternoon mixing.  The observed values in the region just to the north of Lake Erie may not fully represent the kind of hourly concentrations western Pennsylvania will see during the overnight hours into Friday morning.  This will be due to lower mixing heights and lighter winds during the overnight to morning hours with temperatures also cooling overnight to create more stable conditions.  Overnight and early morning concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) are expected to reach Code ORANGE to Code RED levels on an hourly basis when this new plume combines with the existing smoke that is blanketing the region and will mix out some during the afternoon on Friday.  Concentrations of PM-2.5 are expected to be in the Code ORANGE range on average for the full day.  With a mix of sun and clouds ozone concentrations will be limited to the good range.  *** Extended Outlook:  The area of low pressure that has been the source of driving wildfire smoke southward to create our regional air quality issues will finally begin to depart the region by Saturday.  The wind flow will become more westerly.  Conditions will be monitored to see how much is able to be cleared out of the region.  Lingering smoke will allow for moderate air quality for the day.  Increasing sunshine by Sunday may allow ozone concentrations to rise as the smoke departs so that will be monitored as well.  --- Roble|Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection

Overnight and early morning concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) are expected to reach Code ORANGE to Code RED levels on an hourly basis when this new plume combines with the existing smoke that is blanketing the region and will mix out some during the afternoon on Friday.  Concentrations of PM-2.5 are expected to be in the Code ORANGE range on average for the full day.  With a mix of sun and clouds ozone concentrations will be limited to the good range.  *** Extended Outlook:  The area of low pressure that has been the source of driving wildfire smoke southward to create our regional air quality issues will finally begin to depart the region by Saturday.  The wind flow will become more westerly.  Conditions will be monitored to see how much is able to be cleared out of the region.  Lingering smoke will allow for moderate air quality for the day.  Increasing sunshine by Sunday may allow ozone concentrations to rise as the smoke departs so that will be monitored as well.  --- Roble|Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection

Concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) are expected to rise overnight tonight as a plume of wildfire smoke enters the region.  *** Friday’s Forecast:  An area of low pressure continues to spin over New England to bring smoke from wildfires across Quebec southward into the region.  The smoke models for a few days now have been showing a plume of smoke crossing Lake Erie into western Pennsylvania late in the day on Thursday.  Observations where the same models had the plume’s location for Thursday afternoon are not seeing a significant rise in hourly concentrations as the plume passes by.  This may be due to this plume moving through an area with good afternoon mixing.

OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to Moderate range.   …AIR QUALITY ACTION DAY ADVISORY FOR THURSDAY JUNE 8TH AND FRIDAY JUNE 9TH UNTIL NOON  THE ACTION DAY ADVISORY INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING SOUTHERN MICHIGAN COUNTIES:  LAKE, MASON, NEWAYGO, OCEANA, ALLEGAN, KENT, MUSKEGON, OTTAWA, BRANCH, CALHOUN, KALAMAZOO, ST.JOSEPH, BERRIEN, CASS, VAN BUREN, BARRY, CLARE, CLINTON, EATON, GRATIOT, INGHAM, IONIA, ISABELLA, MECOSTA, MONTCALM, OSCEOLA, ARENAC, BAY, GLADWIN, HURON, MIDLAND, SAGINAW, SANILAC, TUSCOLA, GENESEE, LAPEER, SHIAWASSEE, HILLSDALE, JACKSON, LENAWEE, LIVINGSTON, WASHTENAW, MACOMB, MONROE, OAKLAND, ST. CLAIR, WAYNE  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Canadian wildfire smoke continues to drift into our area due to the NNE winds currently in place. The Ontario fires, which are directly impacting us, do not seem to be letting up as we are researching to see the containment of them. The current weather pattern appears to remain in place until at least tomorrow morning when the High-pressure system is expected to drift more south. This will open the door for a Low-pressure and associated cold front to approach the region Saturday afternoon and into Sunday. When this change in weather patterns occurs, we are expecting to see a shift in winds which will be more NNW instead of the current NNE which is bringing the smoke right towards us. But for the next day, we are still expecting PM-2.5 concentrations to exceed the USG range and into the Unhealthy range. We have noticed that these smoke plumes are coming in waves. This explains why for some hours we are seeing USG/Unhealthy PM-2.5 concentrations and for other hours we are seeing Moderate concentrations. But nonetheless, overall PM-2.5 concentrations will be in the USG to Unhealthy range until at least tomorrow, Friday, which is why this forecast will be updated tomorrow morning.

A trough of low pressure aloft and scattered thunderstorms will aid atmospheric mixing and limit ozone development. However, west-northwesterly winds will continue to transport smoke from eastern Canadian wildfires into the state, keeping particle levels elevated. These conditions, combined with high pollutant carryover from the previous day, will lead to Unhealthy AQI levels for PM2.5.  Saturday, June 10 is anticipated to be a Code Orange Air Quality Action Day. Calm to light northwesterly winds early in the day will allow smoke to accumulate across the First State. Furthermore, sunny skies and highs in the low-80s will promote ozone development, while smoke will enhance ozone production. Therefore, despite strengthening west-northwesterly afternoon winds aiding dispersion, AQI levels are anticipated to be Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups for PM2.5.   Sunday, light and variable morning winds will allow pollutants to accumulate in Delaware. Additionally, partly sunny skies and highs near 90F will support ozone formation, while lingering smoke will enhance ozone production and keep particle levels elevated. However, winds will shift to southerly in the afternoon and evening, transporting a cleaner air mass into Delaware and resulting in high-Moderate AQI levels for ozone and PM2.5.|Delaware Dept. of Natural Resources and Environment

Therefore, despite isolated thunderstorms reducing ozone production each afternoon, AQI levels will be Moderate in most cities on both days, with Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups AQI levels expected in Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Lake Charles, and Monroe on Thursday. Saturday, light to moderate southwesterly winds will increase pollutant dispersion and bring a humid, unstable air mass into Louisiana.

OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to Moderate range.   …AIR QUALITY ACTION DAY ADVISORY FOR THURSDAY JUNE 8TH AND FRIDAY JUNE 9TH UNTIL NOON  THE ACTION DAY ADVISORY INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING SOUTHERN MICHIGAN COUNTIES:  LAKE, MASON, NEWAYGO, OCEANA, ALLEGAN, KENT, MUSKEGON, OTTAWA, BRANCH, CALHOUN, KALAMAZOO, ST.JOSEPH, BERRIEN, CASS, VAN BUREN, BARRY, CLARE, CLINTON, EATON, GRATIOT, INGHAM, IONIA, ISABELLA, MECOSTA, MONTCALM, OSCEOLA, ARENAC, BAY, GLADWIN, HURON, MIDLAND, SAGINAW, SANILAC, TUSCOLA, GENESEE, LAPEER, SHIAWASSEE, HILLSDALE, JACKSON, LENAWEE, LIVINGSTON, WASHTENAW, MACOMB, MONROE, OAKLAND, ST. CLAIR, WAYNE  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Canadian wildfire smoke continues to drift into our area due to the NNE winds currently in place. The Ontario fires, which are directly impacting us, do not seem to be letting up as we are researching to see the containment of them. The current weather pattern appears to remain in place until at least tomorrow morning when the High-pressure system is expected to drift more south. This will open the door for a Low-pressure and associated cold front to approach the region Saturday afternoon and into Sunday. When this change in weather patterns occurs, we are expecting to see a shift in winds which will be more NNW instead of the current NNE which is bringing the smoke right towards us. But for the next day, we are still expecting PM-2.5 concentrations to exceed the USG range and into the Unhealthy range. We have noticed that these smoke plumes are coming in waves. This explains why for some hours we are seeing USG/Unhealthy PM-2.5 concentrations and for other hours we are seeing Moderate concentrations. But nonetheless, overall PM-2.5 concentrations will be in the USG to Unhealthy range until at least tomorrow, Friday, which is why this forecast will be updated tomorrow morning.   EXTENDED FORECAST: Wildfire smoke looks to persist for the coming days, so overall air quality will remain poor.

The current weather pattern appears to remain in place until at least tomorrow morning when the High-pressure system is expected to drift more south. This will open the door for a Low-pressure and associated cold front to approach the region Saturday afternoon and into Sunday. When this change in weather patterns occurs, we are expecting to see a shift in winds which will be more NNW instead of the current NNE which is bringing the smoke right towards us. But for the next day, we are still expecting PM-2.5 concentrations to exceed the USG range and into the Unhealthy range. We have noticed that these smoke plumes are coming in waves. This explains why for some hours we are seeing USG/Unhealthy PM-2.5 concentrations and for other hours we are seeing Moderate concentrations. But nonetheless, overall PM-2.5 concentrations will be in the USG to Unhealthy range until at least tomorrow, Friday, which is why this forecast will be updated tomorrow morning.   EXTENDED FORECAST: Wildfire smoke looks to persist for the coming days, so overall air quality will remain poor.

Unhealthy ozone, moderate fine particulate matter from vestigial smoke, and mostly sunny skies characterize this dry air mass.  Scattered showers over western Oklahoma will diminish as the week progresses, and the ozone will persist despite diurnal convection and isolated showers as the air mass stagnates over the state.

The smoke that has infiltrated the Commonwealth continues to make its presence felt in terms of our air quality.  As expected, the poor air quality conditions from this morning have reversed coarse somewhat.  As the morning went along and the inversion, which helped to trap the high levels of PM 2.5 near the ground for a good portion of the morning hours, broke, the winds began to pick up as more vertical mixing occurred.  The winds, in turn, forced PM 2.5 levels to drop drastically from the values recorded this morning.  However, we are not completely out of the woods yet (pun not attended here).  Over the past couple of hours, PM 2.5 levels have leveled off, resulting in more Code ORANGE - Code RED conditions instead of Code PURPLE conditions.  For the rest of today, winds are not expected to increase drastically.  Therefore, some level of smoke will still remain over the region.  Then an inversion sets up shop this evening thereby keeping PM 2.5 concentrations in the Code RED range for today.  In addition to PM 2.5, we are watching ozone, as levels have risen over the past few hours.  That is the benefit of the thinning smoke signature allowing more sunshine and more photochemistry to occur.  Expect continual improvements in the air quality tomorrow. *** Friday's Forecast: So for Friday, expect the worse air quality conditions to persist during the morning hours as the smoke, which remained in place Thursday evening, carries over into the Friday morning.  The plume that will be residing over the area will not be as dense as the one existing over the region on Thursday morning.  Therefore, we do not expect PM 2.5 levels to be as high.  Then, later in the day, the levels will drop as more mixing occurs.  In addition, the threat of afternoon showers exist as a disturbance makes its way northwest to southeast across the area.  These showers will also help PM 2.5 levels to drop.  Afternoon temperatures will continue to be on the cooler side of normal, with highs ranging in the low 70s.  It is the combination of the higher PM 2.5 that is expected during the day and the lower PM 2.5 expected during the afternoon that will help to keep PM 2.5 daily averages in the Code ORANGE range.  Ozone levels will be in the good range thanks to the increased cloud cover limiting the photochemistry needed for ozone formation. *** Extended Outlook: Over the coming days, expect the eyes to continue to be on the air quality in the near term.  We will still contend with some smoke over the region in the near term.  This smoke is not expected to be as thick as the plumes that impacted the area on Wednesday and Thursday though.  Therefore PM 2.5 levels might even drop back to the Code YELLOW to Code ORANGE range for Saturday.  The smoke should thin out even more for Sunday, thus limiting PM 2.5 further.  However, we might have to contend with ozone formation reaching Code ORANGE status thanks to more sunlight and warmer temperatures.  A storm system moving through the region on Monday will help to wash the air mass out.  For the remainder of next week, warm temperatures will persist and air quality will remain in that good to moderate threshold.  Rain chances will also increase during this period. --Nolan|Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection

Concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) are expected to rise overnight tonight as a plume of wildfire smoke enters the region.  *** Friday’s Forecast:  An area of low pressure continues to spin over New England to bring smoke from wildfires across Quebec southward into the region.  The smoke models for a few days now have been showing a plume of smoke crossing Lake Erie into western Pennsylvania late in the day on Thursday.  Observations where the same models had the plume’s location for Thursday afternoon are not seeing a significant rise in hourly concentrations as the plume passes by.  This may be due to this plume moving through an area with good afternoon mixing.  The observed values in the region just to the north of Lake Erie may not fully represent the kind of hourly concentrations western Pennsylvania will see during the overnight hours into Friday morning.  This will be due to lower mixing heights and lighter winds during the overnight to morning hours with temperatures also cooling overnight to create more stable conditions.  Overnight and early morning concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) are expected to reach Code ORANGE to Code RED levels on an hourly basis when this new plume combines with the existing smoke that is blanketing the region and will mix out some during the afternoon on Friday.  Concentrations of PM-2.5 are expected to be in the Code ORANGE range on average for the full day.  *** Extended Outlook:  The area of low pressure that has been the source of driving wildfire smoke southward to create our regional air quality issues will finally begin to depart the region by Saturday.  The wind flow will become more westerly.  Conditions will be monitored to see how much smoke is able to be cleared out of the region.  Lingering smoke will allow for moderate air quality for the day.  --- Roble|Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection

Another dense smoke plume from fires over Quebec will be funneled towards the Mid-Atlantic starting overnight Wednesday into Thursday.  As of Wednesday afternoon this concentrated plume of smoke is working south through Pennsylvania and New York eventually reaching the eastern half of Maryland Wednesday night, raising fine particle concentrations notably.  Nocturnal inversions will help to keep fine particle concentrations elevated through the night Wednesday into Thursday, fostering long-duration exposure to enhanced PM2.5 concentrations for the daily average Thursday.  The highest concentrations and most likely areas of Unhealthy AQI are areas along and north of I-95, though widespread USG is expected.  Some reprieve in concentrations is expected during the afternoon Thursday, but the high morning concentrations will likely keep many areas within the Unhealthy, Code Red AQI range due to fine particles for the daily average.  A front on Friday will bring some reprieve to fine particle concentrations, but due to continued northerly transport from the fire region, USG due to fine particles remains a possibility.

Residual smoke over the Maryland region, particularly along the I-95 corridor, is leading to persistent unhealthy conditions.  This residual smoke will carry-over into Friday morning, leading to some higher concentrations in the overnight hours.  At the same time, smoke from fires over Quebec, while diffuse compared to recent days with lower fine particle concentrations also noted at the surface under the plume will be funneled towards the Mid-Atlantic again on Friday.  Together this transported smoke and residual smoke will keep fine particle concentrations elevated Friday with USG forecast for the daily average.  Where rain occurs Friday, precipitation will scour fine particles from the atmosphere, greatly improving air quality locally.  A general cleaning trend will occur into Saturday, with Moderate air quality expected.  By Sunday, however, with sun and above average temperatures expected, ozone is expected to respond. Diffuse smoke may persist, but ozone will become the lead pollutant, pushing towards the Moderate/USG threshold.

||06/08/23|06/08/23||EDT|0|F|Y|Ludington|MI|43.9553|-86.4525|PM2.5||Moderate|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Thursday June 8th, 2023, through Friday June 9th, 2023  PM-2.5: PM-2.5 concentrations will be in the USG range with some hourly concentrations in the Unhealthy range.   OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to Moderate range.   …AIR QUALITY ACTION DAY ADVISORY FOR THURSDAY JUNE 8TH AND FRIDAY JUNE 9TH UNTIL NOON  THE ACTION DAY ADVISORY INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING SOUTHERN MICHIGAN COUNTIES:  LAKE, MASON, NEWAYGO, OCEANA, ALLEGAN, KENT, MUSKEGON, OTTAWA, BRANCH, CALHOUN, KALAMAZOO, ST.JOSEPH, BERRIEN, CASS, VAN BUREN, BARRY, CLARE, CLINTON, EATON, GRATIOT, INGHAM, IONIA, ISABELLA, MECOSTA, MONTCALM, OSCEOLA, ARENAC, BAY, GLADWIN, HURON, MIDLAND, SAGINAW, SANILAC, TUSCOLA, GENESEE, LAPEER, SHIAWASSEE, HILLSDALE, JACKSON, LENAWEE, LIVINGSTON, WASHTENAW, MACOMB, MONROE, OAKLAND, ST. CLAIR, WAYNE  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Canadian wildfire smoke continues to drift into our area due to the NNE winds currently in place. The Ontario fires, which are directly impacting us, do not seem to be letting up as we are researching to see the containment of them. The current weather pattern appears to remain in place until at least tomorrow morning when the High-pressure system is expected to drift more south. This will open the door for a Low-pressure and associated cold front to approach the region Saturday afternoon and into Sunday. When this change in weather patterns occurs, we are expecting to see a shift in winds which will be more NNW instead of the current NNE which is bringing the smoke right towards us. But for the next day, we are still expecting PM-2.5 concentrations to exceed the USG range and into the Unhealthy range. We have noticed that these smoke plumes are coming in waves. This explains why for some hours we are seeing USG/Unhealthy PM-2.5 concentrations and for other hours we are seeing Moderate concentrations. But nonetheless, overall PM-2.5 concentrations will be in the USG to Unhealthy range until at least tomorrow, Friday, which is why this forecast will be updated tomorrow morning.   EXTENDED FORECAST: Wildfire smoke looks to persist for the coming days, so overall air quality will remain poor.

Another dense smoke plume from fires over Quebec will be funneled towards the Mid-Atlantic starting overnight Wednesday into Thursday.  As of Wednesday afternoon this concentrated plume of smoke is working south through Pennsylvania and New York eventually reaching the eastern half of Maryland Wednesday night, raising fine particle concentrations notably.  Nocturnal inversions will help to keep fine particle concentrations elevated through the night Wednesday into Thursday, fostering long-duration exposure to enhanced PM2.5 concentrations for the daily average Thursday.  The highest concentrations and most likely areas of Unhealthy AQI are areas along and north of I-95, though widespread USG is expected.  Some reprieve in concentrations is expected during the afternoon Thursday, but the high morning concentrations will likely keep many areas within the Unhealthy, Code Red AQI range due to fine particles for the daily average.  A front on Friday will bring some reprieve to fine particle concentrations, but due to continued northerly transport from the fire region, USG due to fine particles remains a possibility.

A general cleaning trend will occur into Saturday, with Moderate air quality expected.  By Sunday, however, with sun and above average temperatures expected, ozone is expected to respond. Diffuse smoke may persist, but ozone will become the lead pollutant, pushing towards the Moderate/USG threshold.

Concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) are expected to rise overnight tonight as a plume of wildfire smoke enters the region.  *** Friday’s Forecast:  An area of low pressure continues to spin over New England to bring smoke from wildfires across Quebec southward into the region.  The smoke models for a few days now have been showing a plume of smoke crossing Lake Erie into western Pennsylvania late in the day on Thursday.  Observations where the same models had the plume’s location for Thursday afternoon are not seeing a significant rise in hourly concentrations as the plume passes by.  This may be due to this plume moving through an area with good afternoon mixing.  The observed values in the region just to the north of Lake Erie may not fully represent the kind of hourly concentrations western Pennsylvania will see during the overnight hours into Friday morning.  This will be due to lower mixing heights and lighter winds during the overnight to morning hours with temperatures also cooling overnight to create more stable conditions.  Overnight and early morning concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) are expected to reach Code ORANGE to Code RED levels on an hourly basis when this new plume combines with the existing smoke that is blanketing the region and will mix out some during the afternoon on Friday.  Concentrations of PM-2.5 are expected to be in the Code ORANGE range on average for the full day.  With a mix of sun and clouds ozone concentrations will be limited to the good range.  *** Extended Outlook:  The area of low pressure that has been the source of driving wildfire smoke southward to create our regional air quality issues will finally begin to depart the region by Saturday.  The wind flow will become more westerly.  Conditions will be monitored to see how much is able to be cleared out of the region.  Lingering smoke will allow for moderate air quality for the day.  Increasing sunshine by Sunday may allow ozone concentrations to rise as the smoke departs so that will be monitored as well.  --- Roble|Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection

Concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) are expected to rise overnight tonight as a plume of wildfire smoke enters the region.  *** Friday’s Forecast:  An area of low pressure continues to spin over New England to bring smoke from wildfires across Quebec southward into the region.  The smoke models for a few days now have been showing a plume of smoke crossing Lake Erie into western Pennsylvania late in the day on Thursday.  Observations where the same models had the plume’s location for Thursday afternoon are not seeing a significant rise in hourly concentrations as the plume passes by.  This may be due to this plume moving through an area with good afternoon mixing.  The observed values in the region just to the north of Lake Erie may not fully represent the kind of hourly concentrations western Pennsylvania will see during the overnight hours into Friday morning.  This will be due to lower mixing heights and lighter winds during the overnight to morning hours with temperatures also cooling overnight to create more stable conditions.  Overnight and early morning concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) are expected to reach Code ORANGE to Code RED levels on an hourly basis when this new plume combines with the existing smoke that is blanketing the region and will mix out some during the afternoon on Friday.

Levels of fine particulates will remain in the unhealthy category statewide on Thursday and extend into the evening hours due to wildfire smoke transport from eastern Canadian wildfires. Some members of the general public may experience health effects, while members of sensitive groups, including those with heart or lung disease, the elderly, and the young, may experience more serious health effects. All individuals should limit strenuous activities and the amount of time active outdoors especially in the evening hours. In addition, ozone is forecast to reach the low moderate category as sunny skies, light winds, and warm temperatures are forecast for the Garden State.  6/9 - An Air Quality Action Day for Particulate Matter (PM2.5) has been declared for Friday, June 9th. Sensitive individuals, including those with heart or lung disease, the elderly, and the young should limit strenuous activities and the amount of time active outdoors. Levels of fine particulates will remain elevated in the unhealthy for sensitive groups category statewide on Friday due to residual Canadian wildfire smoke. Ozone levels are forecast to drop into the good/moderate threshold on Friday as chances for rain are expected to help limit ozone formation in northern portions of the state.|New Jersey Dept. of Environmental Protection

Some members of the general public may experience health effects, while members of sensitive groups, including those with heart or lung disease, the elderly, and the young, may experience more serious health effects. All individuals should limit strenuous activities and the amount of time active outdoors especially in the evening hours. In addition, ozone is forecast to reach the low moderate category as sunny skies, light winds, and warm temperatures are forecast for the Garden State.  6/9 - An Air Quality Action Day for Particulate Matter (PM2.5) has been declared for Friday, June 9th. Sensitive individuals, including those with heart or lung disease, the elderly, and the young should limit strenuous activities and the amount of time active outdoors. Levels of fine particulates will remain elevated in the unhealthy for sensitive groups category statewide on Friday due to residual Canadian wildfire smoke. Ozone levels are forecast to drop into the good/moderate threshold on Friday as chances for rain are expected to help limit ozone formation in northern portions of the state.|New Jersey Dept. of Environmental Protection

Ozone levels are forecast to drop into the good/moderate threshold on Friday as chances for rain are expected to help limit ozone formation in northern portions of the state.|New Jersey Dept. of Environmental Protection

Levels of fine particulates will remain in the unhealthy category statewide on Thursday and extend into the evening hours due to wildfire smoke transport from eastern Canadian wildfires. Some members of the general public may experience health effects, while members of sensitive groups, including those with heart or lung disease, the elderly, and the young, may experience more serious health effects. All individuals should limit strenuous activities and the amount of time active outdoors especially in the evening hours. In addition, ozone is forecast to reach the low moderate category as sunny skies, light winds, and warm temperatures are forecast for the Garden State.  6/9 - An Air Quality Action Day for Particulate Matter (PM2.5) has been declared for Friday, June 9th. Sensitive individuals, including those with heart or lung disease, the elderly, and the young should limit strenuous activities and the amount of time active outdoors. Levels of fine particulates will remain elevated in the unhealthy for sensitive groups category statewide on Friday due to residual Canadian wildfire smoke. Ozone levels are forecast to drop into the good/moderate threshold on Friday as chances for rain are expected to help limit ozone formation in northern portions of the state.|New Jersey Dept. of Environmental Protection

Another dense smoke plume from fires over Quebec will be funneled towards the Mid-Atlantic starting overnight Wednesday into Thursday.  As of Wednesday afternoon this concentrated plume of smoke is working south through Pennsylvania and New York eventually reaching the eastern half of Maryland Wednesday night, raising fine particle concentrations notably.  Nocturnal inversions will help to keep fine particle concentrations elevated through the night Wednesday into Thursday, fostering long-duration exposure to enhanced PM2.5 concentrations for the daily average Thursday.  The highest concentrations and most likely areas of Unhealthy AQI are areas along and north of I-95, though widespread USG is expected.  Some reprieve in concentrations is expected during the afternoon Thursday, but the high morning concentrations will likely keep many areas within the Unhealthy, Code Red AQI range due to fine particles for the daily average.  A front on Friday will bring some reprieve to fine particle concentrations, but due to continued northerly transport from the fire region, USG due to fine particles remains a possibility.

Unhealthy ozone, moderate fine particulate matter from vestigial smoke, and mostly sunny skies characterize this dry air mass.  Scattered showers over western Oklahoma will diminish as the week progresses, and the ozone will persist despite diurnal convection and isolated showers as the air mass stagnates over the state.  Efficient gas-to-particle conversion in diurnally cycling convective clouds will contribute to accumulation of fine particulate matter.  More numerous, even perhaps locally heavy, rain showers may lead to a diminution of pollution during the forthcoming weekend.|Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality

||06/08/23|06/08/23||EDT|0|F|Y|Philadelphia|PA|39.9500|-75.1510|PM2.5|200|Unhealthy|Yes|Current Conditions: As of 2 PM on Thursday, the word of the day continues to be smoke, thanks to the ongoing forest fire situation across eastern Canada.  The smoke that has infiltrated the Commonwealth continues to make its presence felt in terms of our air quality.  As expected, the poor air quality conditions from this morning have reversed coarse somewhat.  As the morning went along and the inversion, which helped to trap the high levels of PM 2.5 near the ground for a good portion of the morning hours, broke, the winds began to pick up as more vertical mixing occurred.  The winds, in turn, forced PM 2.5 levels to drop drastically from the values recorded this morning.  However, we are not completely out of the woods yet (pun not attended here).  Over the past couple of hours, PM 2.5 levels have leveled off, resulting in more Code ORANGE - Code RED conditions instead of Code PURPLE conditions.  For the rest of today, winds are not expected to increase drastically.  Therefore, some level of smoke will still remain over the region.  Then an inversion sets up shop this evening thereby keeping PM 2.5 concentrations in the Code RED range for today.  In addition to PM 2.5, we are watching ozone, as levels have risen over the past few hours.  That is the benefit of the thinning smoke signature allowing more sunshine and more photochemistry to occur.  Expect continual improvements in the air quality tomorrow. *** Friday's Forecast: So for Friday, expect the worse air quality conditions to persist during the morning hours as the smoke, which remained in place Thursday evening, carries over into the Friday morning.  The plume that will be residing over the area will not be as dense as the one existing over the region on Thursday morning.  Therefore, we do not expect PM 2.5 levels to be as high.  Then, later in the day, the levels will drop as more mixing occurs.  In addition, the threat of afternoon showers exist as a disturbance makes its way northwest to southeast across the area.  These showers will also help PM 2.5 levels to drop.  Afternoon temperatures will continue to be on the cooler side of normal, with highs ranging in the low 70s.  It is the combination of the higher PM 2.5 that is expected during the day and the lower PM 2.5 expected during the afternoon that will help to keep PM 2.5 daily averages in the Code ORANGE range.  Ozone levels will be in the good range thanks to the increased cloud cover limiting the photochemistry needed for ozone formation. *** Extended Outlook: Over the coming days, expect the eyes to continue to be on the air quality in the near term.  We will still contend with some smoke over the region in the near term.  This smoke is not expected to be as thick as the plumes that impacted the area on Wednesday and Thursday though.  Therefore PM 2.5 levels might even drop back to the Code YELLOW to Code ORANGE range for Saturday.  The smoke should thin out even more for Sunday, thus limiting PM 2.5 further.  However, we might have to contend with ozone formation reaching Code ORANGE status thanks to more sunlight and warmer temperatures.  A storm system moving through the region on Monday will help to wash the air mass out.  For the remainder of next week, warm temperatures will persist and air quality will remain in that good to moderate threshold.  Rain chances will also increase during this period. --Nolan|Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection

Ozone levels will be in the good range thanks to the increased cloud cover limiting the photochemistry needed for ozone formation. *** Extended Outlook: Over the coming days, expect the eyes to continue to be on the air quality in the near term.  We will still contend with some smoke over the region in the near term.  This smoke is not expected to be as thick as the plumes that impacted the area on Wednesday and Thursday though.  Therefore PM 2.5 levels might even drop back to the Code YELLOW to Code ORANGE range for Saturday.  The smoke should thin out even more for Sunday, thus limiting PM 2.5 further.  However, we might have to contend with ozone formation reaching Code ORANGE status thanks to more sunlight and warmer temperatures.  A storm system moving through the region on Monday will help to wash the air mass out.  For the remainder of next week, warm temperatures will persist and air quality will remain in that good to moderate threshold.  Rain chances will also increase during this period. --Nolan|Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection

The smoke that has infiltrated the Commonwealth continues to make its presence felt in terms of our air quality.  As expected, the poor air quality conditions from this morning have reversed coarse somewhat.  As the morning went along and the inversion, which helped to trap the high levels of PM 2.5 near the ground for a good portion of the morning hours, broke, the winds began to pick up as more vertical mixing occurred.  The winds, in turn, forced PM 2.5 levels to drop drastically from the values recorded this morning.  However, we are not completely out of the woods yet (pun not attended here).  Over the past couple of hours, PM 2.5 levels have leveled off, resulting in more Code ORANGE - Code RED conditions instead of Code PURPLE conditions.  For the rest of today, winds are not expected to increase drastically.  Therefore, some level of smoke will still remain over the region.  Then an inversion sets up shop this evening thereby keeping PM 2.5 concentrations in the Code RED range for today.  In addition to PM 2.5, we are watching ozone, as levels have risen over the past few hours.  That is the benefit of the thinning smoke signature allowing more sunshine and more photochemistry to occur.  Expect continual improvements in the air quality tomorrow. *** Friday's Forecast: So for Friday, expect the worse air quality conditions to persist during the morning hours as the smoke, which remained in place Thursday evening, carries over into the Friday morning.  The plume that will be residing over the area will not be as dense as the one existing over the region on Thursday morning.  Therefore, we do not expect PM 2.5 levels to be as high.  Then, later in the day, the levels will drop as more mixing occurs.  In addition, the threat of afternoon showers exist as a disturbance makes its way northwest to southeast across the area.  These showers will also help PM 2.5 levels to drop.  Afternoon temperatures will continue to be on the cooler side of normal, with highs ranging in the low 70s.

Concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) are expected to rise overnight tonight as a plume of wildfire smoke enters the region.  *** Friday’s Forecast:  An area of low pressure continues to spin over New England to bring smoke from wildfires across Quebec southward into the region.  The smoke models for a few days now have been showing a plume of smoke crossing Lake Erie into western Pennsylvania late in the day on Thursday.  Observations where the same models had the plume’s location for Thursday afternoon are not seeing a significant rise in hourly concentrations as the plume passes by.  This may be due to this plume moving through an area with good afternoon mixing.  The observed values in the region just to the north of Lake Erie may not fully represent the kind of hourly concentrations western Pennsylvania will see during the overnight hours into Friday morning.  This will be due to lower mixing heights and lighter winds during the overnight to morning hours with temperatures also cooling overnight to create more stable conditions.  Overnight and early morning concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) are expected to reach Code ORANGE to Code RED levels on an hourly basis when this new plume combines with the existing smoke that is blanketing the region and will mix out some during the afternoon on Friday.  Concentrations of PM-2.5 are expected to be in the Code ORANGE range on average for the full day.  With a mix of sun and clouds ozone concentrations will be limited to the good range.  *** Extended Outlook:  The area of low pressure that has been the source of driving wildfire smoke southward to create our regional air quality issues will finally begin to depart the region by Saturday.  The wind flow will become more westerly.  Conditions will be monitored to see how much smoke is able to be cleared out of the region.  Lingering smoke will allow for moderate air quality for the day.  Increasing sunshine by Sunday may allow ozone concentrations to rise as the smoke departs so that will be monitored as well.  --- Roble|Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection

Once this system fades away tomorrow, another trough is expected to approach California this weekend and continue the below-normal temperature trend.  Hidden Valley saw more PM10 spikes this morning from the light SE winds which transported the dust pollution from the nearby activities and is forecasted to reach the upper-Moderate AQI today.  For other sites, the PM10 is forecasted to remain in the Good before the next trough comes by with more winds.  Since there are multiple troughs located in California, the winds are expected to continue blowing SW which will keep the ozone levels low.

Levels of fine particulates will remain in the unhealthy category statewide on Thursday and extend into the evening hours due to wildfire smoke transport from eastern Canadian wildfires. Some members of the general public may experience health effects, while members of sensitive groups, including those with heart or lung disease, the elderly, and the young, may experience more serious health effects. All individuals should limit strenuous activities and the amount of time active outdoors especially in the evening hours. In addition, ozone is forecast to reach the low moderate category as sunny skies, light winds, and warm temperatures are forecast for the Garden State.  6/9 - An Air Quality Action Day for Particulate Matter (PM2.5) has been declared for Friday, June 9th. Sensitive individuals, including those with heart or lung disease, the elderly, and the young should limit strenuous activities and the amount of time active outdoors. Levels of fine particulates will remain elevated in the unhealthy for sensitive groups category statewide on Friday due to residual Canadian wildfire smoke. Ozone levels are forecast to drop into the good/moderate threshold on Friday as chances for rain are expected to help limit ozone formation in northern portions of the state.|New Jersey Dept. of Environmental Protection

OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to Moderate range.   …AIR QUALITY ACTION DAY ADVISORY FOR THURSDAY JUNE 8TH AND FRIDAY JUNE 9TH UNTIL NOON  THE ACTION DAY ADVISORY INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING SOUTHERN MICHIGAN COUNTIES:  LAKE, MASON, NEWAYGO, OCEANA, ALLEGAN, KENT, MUSKEGON, OTTAWA, BRANCH, CALHOUN, KALAMAZOO, ST.JOSEPH, BERRIEN, CASS, VAN BUREN, BARRY, CLARE, CLINTON, EATON, GRATIOT, INGHAM, IONIA, ISABELLA, MECOSTA, MONTCALM, OSCEOLA, ARENAC, BAY, GLADWIN, HURON, MIDLAND, SAGINAW, SANILAC, TUSCOLA, GENESEE, LAPEER, SHIAWASSEE, HILLSDALE, JACKSON, LENAWEE, LIVINGSTON, WASHTENAW, MACOMB, MONROE, OAKLAND, ST. CLAIR, WAYNE  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Canadian wildfire smoke continues to drift into our area due to the NNE winds currently in place. The Ontario fires, which are directly impacting us, do not seem to be letting up as we are researching to see the containment of them. The current weather pattern appears to remain in place until at least tomorrow morning when the High-pressure system is expected to drift more south. This will open the door for a Low-pressure and associated cold front to approach the region Saturday afternoon and into Sunday. When this change in weather patterns occurs, we are expecting to see a shift in winds which will be more NNW instead of the current NNE which is bringing the smoke right towards us. But for the next day, we are still expecting PM-2.5 concentrations to exceed the USG range and into the Unhealthy range. We have noticed that these smoke plumes are coming in waves. This explains why for some hours we are seeing USG/Unhealthy PM-2.5 concentrations and for other hours we are seeing Moderate concentrations. But nonetheless, overall PM-2.5 concentrations will be in the USG to Unhealthy range until at least tomorrow, Friday, which is why this forecast will be updated tomorrow morning.

Once this system fades away tomorrow, another trough is expected to approach California this weekend and continue the below-normal temperature trend.  Hidden Valley saw more PM10 spikes this morning from the light SE winds which transported the dust pollution from the nearby activities and is forecasted to reach the upper-Moderate AQI today.  For other sites, the PM10 is forecasted to remain in the Good before the next trough comes by with more winds.  Since there are multiple troughs located in California, the winds are expected to continue blowing SW which will keep the ozone levels low. However, we are experiencing a gap between two troughs with lighter westerly winds today and tomorrow, so the ozone has the potential to rise toward the upper-Moderate AQI.  The strong winds will return this weekend and might see more Good days.  Stay tuned and check back tomorrow for an updated air quality forecast.|Pinal County Air Quality Control District

The strong winds will return this weekend and might see more Good days.  Stay tuned and check back tomorrow for an updated air quality forecast.|Pinal County Air Quality Control District

Light winds overnight have slowed the southward progression of a thick plume of wildfire smoke through Pennsylvania that produced unhealthy levels of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) across the area on Wednesday.  This has led to concentrations during the overnight hours remaining more elevated but will improve a little bit during the day today.  The Air Quality Action Day remains in effect with a change from Code Orange to Code Red levels on average for the whole day.   *** Thursday's Forecast: For Thursday, expect the smoky conditions that have persisted over the past two days to continue to persist through much of the day.  The highest air quality levels are expected to occur during the morning hours, as the air mass that settled in Wednesday night continues to persist over our area.  Expect the air quality levels to decrease during the day thanks to a slight transition in the overall weather pattern.  The main low-pressure system over Nova Scotia will begin to retrograde (i.e. move from east to west) across the eastern Canada.  This westward movement will change the orientation of the winds over PA.  Model guidance indicates that the plume will actually shift further to the west, thus relaxing the onslaught of smoke over eastern PA.    Afternoon temperatures will stay slightly below normal, with highs in the low 70s.  Even with the declining levels of PM 2.5 expected, overall averages should at least remain well within the Code RED range. *** Extended Outlook: Over the coming days, expect the air quality to continue to improve in the near term as the overall weather continues to change from the one that impacted our weather over the past few days.  The area of low pressure, that began to back in over eastern Canada on Thursday, will finally move out over the next few days as a new storm system builds in from the Great Lakes region.  The movement of this storm system near our area will allow all of the smoke to retreat and allow the air quality (PM 2.5, primarily) to improve.  However, we could see ozone rise in advance of the frontal passage, as a result of increased sunshine allowing the photochemistry necessary for ozone production to occur.  The storm system will press through our area in the late Monday - early Tuesday time frame.  As it pushes through, expect some much need rain to provide some much-needed water to some very dry yards.  After an initial bump down, expect temperatures to rebound in the low to mid 80s by week's end as more of a zonal wind flow sets up over the area.  Overall, air quality levels could still remain elevated over the weekend.  The passage of the front though on Monday into Tuesday will provide some brief relief to air quality levels.  Air quality conditions will likely rise by week's end (not as high as what we are currently experiencing, thankfully!) as warmer temperatures move in. --Nolan/Roble|Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection

As of Wednesday afternoon this concentrated plume of smoke is working south through Pennsylvania and New York eventually reaching the eastern half of Maryland Wednesday night, raising fine particle concentrations notably.  Nocturnal inversions will help to keep fine particle concentrations elevated through the night Wednesday into Thursday, fostering long-duration exposure to enhanced PM2.5 concentrations for the daily average Thursday.  The highest concentrations and most likely areas of Unhealthy AQI are areas along and north of I-95, though widespread USG is expected.

Together this transported smoke and residual smoke will keep fine particle concentrations elevated Friday with USG forecast for the daily average.  Where rain occurs Friday, precipitation will scour fine particles from the atmosphere, greatly improving air quality locally.  A general cleaning trend will occur into Saturday, with Moderate air quality expected.  By Sunday, however, with sun and above average temperatures expected, ozone is expected to respond. Diffuse smoke may persist, but ozone will become the lead pollutant, pushing towards the Moderate/USG threshold.

Once this system fades away tomorrow, another trough is expected to approach California this weekend and continue the below-normal temperature trend.  Hidden Valley saw more PM10 spikes this morning from the light SE winds which transported the dust pollution from the nearby activities and is forecasted to reach the upper-Moderate AQI today.  For other sites, the PM10 is forecasted to remain in the Good before the next trough comes by with more winds.  Since there are multiple troughs located in California, the winds are expected to continue blowing SW which will keep the ozone levels low. However, we are experiencing a gap between two troughs with lighter westerly winds today and tomorrow, so the ozone has the potential to rise toward the upper-Moderate AQI.  The strong winds will return this weekend and might see more Good days.  Stay tuned and check back tomorrow for an updated air quality forecast.|Pinal County Air Quality Control District

Light winds overnight have slowed the southward progression of a thick plume of wildfire smoke through Pennsylvania that produced unhealthy levels of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) across the area on Wednesday.  This has led to concentrations during the overnight hours remaining more elevated but will improve a little bit during the day today.  *** Thursday's Forecast: For Thursday, expect the smoky conditions that have persisted over the past two days to continue to persist through much of the day.  The highest air quality levels are expected to occur during the morning hours, as the air mass that settled in Wednesday night continues to persist over our area.  Expect the air quality levels to decrease during the day thanks to a slight transition in the overall weather pattern.  The main low-pressure system over Nova Scotia will begin to retrograde (i.e. move from east to west) across the eastern Canada.  This westward movement will change the orientation of the winds over PA.  Model guidance indicates that the plume will actually shift further to the west, thus relaxing the onslaught of smoke over eastern PA.    Afternoon temperatures will stay slightly below normal, with highs in the low 70s.  Even with the declining levels of PM 2.5 expected, overall averages should at least remain well within the Code RED range. *** Extended Outlook: Over the coming days, expect the air quality to continue to improve in the near term as the overall weather continues to change from the one that impacted our weather over the past few days.  The area of low pressure, that began to back in over eastern Canada on Thursday, will finally move out over the next few days as a new storm system builds in from the Great Lakes region.  The movement of this storm system near our area will allow all of the smoke to retreat and allow the air quality (PM 2.5, primarily) to improve.  However, we could see ozone rise in advance of the frontal passage, as a result of increased sunshine allowing the photochemistry necessary for ozone production to occur.  The storm system will press through our area in the late Monday - early Tuesday time frame.  As it pushes through, expect some much need rain to provide some much-needed water to some very dry yards.  After an initial bump down, expect temperatures to rebound in the low to mid 80s by week's end as more of a zonal wind flow sets up over the area.  Overall, air quality levels could still remain elevated over the weekend.  The passage of the front though on Monday into Tuesday will provide some brief relief to air quality levels.  Air quality conditions will likely rise by week's end (not as high as what we are currently experiencing, thankfully!) as warmer temperatures move in. --Nolan/Roble|Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection

Light winds overnight have slowed the southward progression of a thick plume of wildfire smoke through Pennsylvania that produced unhealthy levels of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) across the area on Wednesday.  This has led to concentrations during the overnight hours remaining more elevated but will improve a little bit during the day today.  *** Thursday's Forecast: For Thursday, expect the smoky conditions that have persisted over the past two days to continue to persist through much of the day.  The highest air quality levels are expected to occur during the morning hours, as the air mass that settled in Wednesday night continues to persist over our area.  Expect the air quality levels to decrease during the day thanks to a slight transition in the overall weather pattern.  The main low-pressure system over Nova Scotia will begin to retrograde (i.e. move from east to west) across the eastern Canada.  This westward movement will change the orientation of the winds over PA.  Model guidance indicates that the plume will actually shift further to the west, thus relaxing the onslaught of smoke over eastern PA.    Afternoon temperatures will stay slightly below normal, with highs in the low 70s.  Even with the declining levels of PM 2.5 expected, overall averages should at least remain well within the Code RED range. *** Extended Outlook: Over the coming days, expect the air quality to continue to improve in the near term as the overall weather continues to change from the one that impacted our weather over the past few days.  The area of low pressure, that began to back in over eastern Canada on Thursday, will finally move out over the next few days as a new storm system builds in from the Great Lakes region.  The movement of this storm system near our area will allow all of the smoke to retreat and allow the air quality (PM 2.5, primarily) to improve.  However, we could see ozone rise in advance of the frontal passage, as a result of increased sunshine allowing the photochemistry necessary for ozone production to occur.  The storm system will press through our area in the late Monday - early Tuesday time frame.  As it pushes through, expect some much need rain to provide some much-needed water to some very dry yards.  After an initial bump down, expect temperatures to rebound in the low to mid 80s by week's end as more of a zonal wind flow sets up over the area.  Overall, air quality levels could still remain elevated over the weekend.  The passage of the front though on Monday into Tuesday will provide some brief relief to air quality levels.  Air quality conditions will likely rise by week's end (not as high as what we are currently experiencing, thankfully!) as warmer temperatures move in. --Nolan/Roble|Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection

The smoke that has infiltrated the Commonwealth continues to make its presence felt in terms of our air quality.  As expected, the poor air quality conditions from this morning have reversed coarse somewhat.  As the morning went along and the inversion, which helped to trap the high levels of PM 2.5 near the ground for a good portion of the morning hours, broke, the winds began to pick up as more vertical mixing occurred.  The winds, in turn, forced PM 2.5 levels to drop drastically from the values recorded this morning.  However, we are not completely out of the woods yet (pun not attended here).  Over the past couple of hours, PM 2.5 levels have leveled off, resulting in more Code ORANGE - Code RED conditions instead of Code PURPLE conditions.  For the rest of today, winds are not expected to increase drastically.  Therefore, some level of smoke will still remain over the region.  Then an inversion sets up shop this evening thereby keeping PM 2.5 concentrations in the Code RED range for today.  In addition to PM 2.5, we are watching ozone, as levels have risen over the past few hours.  That is the benefit of the thinning smoke signature allowing more sunshine and more photochemistry to occur.  Expect continual improvements in the air quality tomorrow. *** Friday's Forecast: So for Friday, expect the worse air quality conditions to persist during the morning hours as the smoke, which remained in place Thursday evening, carries over into the Friday morning.  The plume that will be residing over the area will not be as dense as the one existing over the region on Thursday morning.  Therefore, we do not expect PM 2.5 levels to be as high.  Then, later in the day, the levels will drop as more mixing occurs.  In addition, the threat of afternoon showers exist as a disturbance makes its way northwest to southeast across the area.  These showers will also help PM 2.5 levels to drop.  Afternoon temperatures will continue to be on the cooler side of normal, with highs ranging in the low 70s.  It is the combination of the higher PM 2.5 that is expected during the day and the lower PM 2.5 expected during the afternoon that will help to keep PM 2.5 daily averages in the Code ORANGE range.  Ozone levels will be in the good range thanks to the increased cloud cover limiting the photochemistry needed for ozone formation. *** Extended Outlook: Over the coming days, expect the eyes to continue to be on the air quality in the near term.  We will still contend with some smoke over the region in the near term.  This smoke is not expected to be as thick as the plumes that impacted the area on Wednesday and Thursday though.  Therefore PM 2.5 levels might even drop back to the Code YELLOW to Code ORANGE range for Saturday.  The smoke should thin out even more for Sunday, thus limiting PM 2.5 further.  However, we might have to contend with ozone formation reaching Code ORANGE status thanks to more sunlight and warmer temperatures.  A storm system moving through the region on Monday will help to wash the air mass out.  For the remainder of next week, warm temperatures will persist and air quality will remain in that good to moderate threshold.  Rain chances will also increase during this period. --Nolan|Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection

The smoke that has infiltrated the Commonwealth continues to make its presence felt in terms of our air quality.  As expected, the poor air quality conditions from this morning have reversed coarse somewhat.  As the morning went along and the inversion, which helped to trap the high levels of PM 2.5 near the ground for a good portion of the morning hours, broke, the winds began to pick up as more vertical mixing occurred.  The winds, in turn, forced PM 2.5 levels to drop drastically from the values recorded this morning.  However, we are not completely out of the woods yet (pun not attended here).  Over the past couple of hours, PM 2.5 levels have leveled off, resulting in more Code ORANGE - Code RED conditions instead of Code PURPLE conditions.  For the rest of today, winds are not expected to increase drastically.  Therefore, some level of smoke will still remain over the region.  Then an inversion sets up shop this evening thereby keeping PM 2.5 concentrations in the Code RED range for today.  In addition to PM 2.5, we are watching ozone, as levels have risen over the past few hours.  That is the benefit of the thinning smoke signature allowing more sunshine and more photochemistry to occur.  Expect continual improvements in the air quality tomorrow. *** Friday's Forecast: So for Friday, expect the worse air quality conditions to persist during the morning hours as the smoke, which remained in place Thursday evening, carries over into the Friday morning.  The plume that will be residing over the area will not be as dense as the one existing over the region on Thursday morning.  Therefore, we do not expect PM 2.5 levels to be as high.  Then, later in the day, the levels will drop as more mixing occurs.  In addition, the threat of afternoon showers exist as a disturbance makes its way northwest to southeast across the area.  These showers will also help PM 2.5 levels to drop.  Afternoon temperatures will continue to be on the cooler side of normal, with highs ranging in the low 70s.  It is the combination of the higher PM 2.5 that is expected during the day and the lower PM 2.5 expected during the afternoon that will help to keep PM 2.5 daily averages in the Code ORANGE range.  Ozone levels will be in the good range thanks to the increased cloud cover limiting the photochemistry needed for ozone formation. *** Extended Outlook: Over the coming days, expect the eyes to continue to be on the air quality in the near term.  We will still contend with some smoke over the region in the near term.  This smoke is not expected to be as thick as the plumes that impacted the area on Wednesday and Thursday though.  Therefore PM 2.5 levels might even drop back to the Code YELLOW to Code ORANGE range for Saturday.  The smoke should thin out even more for Sunday, thus limiting PM 2.5 further.  However, we might have to contend with ozone formation reaching Code ORANGE status thanks to more sunlight and warmer temperatures.  A storm system moving through the region on Monday will help to wash the air mass out.  For the remainder of next week, warm temperatures will persist and air quality will remain in that good to moderate threshold.  Rain chances will also increase during this period. --Nolan|Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection

Temperatures all this week will be on the cooler side than we’ve experienced as of late. There will be a small chance for rain on Wednesday, but a dry forecast for the rest of the period.  Partly sunny with haze today and highs around 80. Northeast winds will be at 5 to 10 mph. Dew points will be in the upper 30s and afternoon minimum relative humidities no lower than 23%. For tomorrow (Tuesday) mostly sunny with highs in the lower 80s. Light north northwest winds in the morning will increase to 5 to 10 mph. Dew points will be in the upper 40s and afternoon minimum relative humidities no lower than 30%. Wednesday be partly sunny with a small chance for showers and highs around 80. East northeast winds will be 5 to 10 mph. Dew points will be around the lower 40s and afternoon minimum relative humidities no lower than 30%.   Forecast a bit of a borderline situation for Ozone Air Quality between USG (Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups) and Moderate categories. Thinking is that this slowly sinking backdoor cold front will prevent conditions from getting worse than Moderate, despite the column being somewhat still dry. Clouds will also be around the area, and temperatures are not as hot as they have been. So even with this low humidity thinking going Moderate for the area makes the most sense at this time. Moderate also makes the most sense for PM2.5 as well because of the aforementioned reasons and that there shouldn’t be any large scale plumes from the fires up north that will impact the area.|Indiana Dept. of Environmental Management 2

OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to Moderate range.   …AIR QUALITY ACTION DAY ADVISORY FOR THURSDAY JUNE 8TH AND FRIDAY JUNE 9TH UNTIL NOON  THE ACTION DAY ADVISORY INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING SOUTHERN MICHIGAN COUNTIES:  LAKE, MASON, NEWAYGO, OCEANA, ALLEGAN, KENT, MUSKEGON, OTTAWA, BRANCH, CALHOUN, KALAMAZOO, ST.JOSEPH, BERRIEN, CASS, VAN BUREN, BARRY, CLARE, CLINTON, EATON, GRATIOT, INGHAM, IONIA, ISABELLA, MECOSTA, MONTCALM, OSCEOLA, ARENAC, BAY, GLADWIN, HURON, MIDLAND, SAGINAW, SANILAC, TUSCOLA, GENESEE, LAPEER, SHIAWASSEE, HILLSDALE, JACKSON, LENAWEE, LIVINGSTON, WASHTENAW, MACOMB, MONROE, OAKLAND, ST. CLAIR, WAYNE  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Canadian wildfire smoke continues to drift into our area due to the NNE winds currently in place. The Ontario fires, which are directly impacting us, do not seem to be letting up as we are researching to see the containment of them. The current weather pattern appears to remain in place until at least tomorrow morning when the High-pressure system is expected to drift more south. This will open the door for a Low-pressure and associated cold front to approach the region Saturday afternoon and into Sunday. When this change in weather patterns occurs, we are expecting to see a shift in winds which will be more NNW instead of the current NNE which is bringing the smoke right towards us. But for the next day, we are still expecting PM-2.5 concentrations to exceed the USG range and into the Unhealthy range. We have noticed that these smoke plumes are coming in waves. This explains why for some hours we are seeing USG/Unhealthy PM-2.5 concentrations and for other hours we are seeing Moderate concentrations. But nonetheless, overall PM-2.5 concentrations will be in the USG to Unhealthy range until at least tomorrow, Friday, which is why this forecast will be updated tomorrow morning.   EXTENDED FORECAST: Wildfire smoke looks to persist for the coming days, so overall air quality will remain poor.

||06/08/23|06/09/23||EDT|1|F|N|Traverse City|MI|44.7544|-85.6029|OZONE||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Thursday June 8th, 2023, through Friday June 9th, 2023  PM-2.5: PM-2.5 concentrations will be in the USG range with some hourly concentrations in the Unhealthy range.   OZONE: Ozone concentrations are expected to be in the Good to Moderate range.   …AIR QUALITY ACTION DAY ADVISORY FOR THURSDAY JUNE 8TH AND FRIDAY JUNE 9TH UNTIL NOON  THE ACTION DAY ADVISORY INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING SOUTHERN MICHIGAN COUNTIES:  LAKE, MASON, NEWAYGO, OCEANA, ALLEGAN, KENT, MUSKEGON, OTTAWA, BRANCH, CALHOUN, KALAMAZOO, ST.JOSEPH, BERRIEN, CASS, VAN BUREN, BARRY, CLARE, CLINTON, EATON, GRATIOT, INGHAM, IONIA, ISABELLA, MECOSTA, MONTCALM, OSCEOLA, ARENAC, BAY, GLADWIN, HURON, MIDLAND, SAGINAW, SANILAC, TUSCOLA, GENESEE, LAPEER, SHIAWASSEE, HILLSDALE, JACKSON, LENAWEE, LIVINGSTON, WASHTENAW, MACOMB, MONROE, OAKLAND, ST. CLAIR, WAYNE  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  Canadian wildfire smoke continues to drift into our area due to the NNE winds currently in place. The Ontario fires, which are directly impacting us, do not seem to be letting up as we are researching to see the containment of them. The current weather pattern appears to remain in place until at least tomorrow morning when the High-pressure system is expected to drift more south. This will open the door for a Low-pressure and associated cold front to approach the region Saturday afternoon and into Sunday. When this change in weather patterns occurs, we are expecting to see a shift in winds which will be more NNW instead of the current NNE which is bringing the smoke right towards us. But for the next day, we are still expecting PM-2.5 concentrations to exceed the USG range and into the Unhealthy range. We have noticed that these smoke plumes are coming in waves. This explains why for some hours we are seeing USG/Unhealthy PM-2.5 concentrations and for other hours we are seeing Moderate concentrations. But nonetheless, overall PM-2.5 concentrations will be in the USG to Unhealthy range until at least tomorrow, Friday, which is why this forecast will be updated tomorrow morning.   EXTENDED FORECAST: Wildfire smoke looks to persist for the coming days, so overall air quality will remain poor.

Another dense smoke plume from fires over Quebec will be funneled towards the Mid-Atlantic starting overnight Wednesday into Thursday.  As of Wednesday afternoon this concentrated plume of smoke is working south through Pennsylvania and New York eventually reaching the eastern half of Maryland Wednesday night, raising fine particle concentrations notably.  Nocturnal inversions will help to keep fine particle concentrations elevated through the night Wednesday into Thursday, fostering long-duration exposure to enhanced PM2.5 concentrations for the daily average Thursday.  The highest concentrations and most likely areas of Unhealthy AQI are areas along and north of I-95, though widespread USG is expected.  Some reprieve in concentrations is expected during the afternoon Thursday, but the high morning concentrations will likely keep many areas within the Unhealthy, Code Red AQI range due to fine particles for the daily average.  A front on Friday will bring some reprieve to fine particle concentrations, but due to continued northerly transport from the fire region, USG due to fine particles remains a possibility.

Residual smoke over the Maryland region, particularly along the I-95 corridor, is leading to persistent unhealthy conditions.  This residual smoke will carry-over into Friday morning, leading to some higher concentrations in the overnight hours.  At the same time, smoke from fires over Quebec, while diffuse compared to recent days with lower fine particle concentrations also noted at the surface under the plume will be funneled towards the Mid-Atlantic again on Friday.  Together this transported smoke and residual smoke will keep fine particle concentrations elevated Friday with USG forecast for the daily average.  Where rain occurs Friday, precipitation will scour fine particles from the atmosphere, greatly improving air quality locally.  A general cleaning trend will occur into Saturday, with Moderate air quality expected.  By Sunday, however, with sun and above average temperatures expected, ozone is expected to respond. Diffuse smoke may persist, but ozone will become the lead pollutant, pushing towards the Moderate/USG threshold.

Another dense smoke plume from fires over Quebec will be funneled towards the Mid-Atlantic starting overnight Wednesday into Thursday.  As of Wednesday afternoon this concentrated plume of smoke is working south through Pennsylvania and New York eventually reaching the eastern half of Maryland Wednesday night, raising fine particle concentrations notably.  Nocturnal inversions will help to keep fine particle concentrations elevated through the night Wednesday into Thursday, fostering long-duration exposure to enhanced PM2.5 concentrations for the daily average Thursday.  The highest concentrations and most likely areas of Unhealthy AQI are areas along and north of I-95, though widespread USG is expected.  Some reprieve in concentrations is expected during the afternoon Thursday, but the high morning concentrations will likely keep many areas within the Unhealthy, Code Red AQI range due to fine particles for the daily average.  A front on Friday will bring some reprieve to fine particle concentrations, but due to continued northerly transport from the fire region, USG due to fine particles remains a possibility.

Residual smoke over the Maryland region, particularly along the I-95 corridor, is leading to persistent unhealthy conditions.  This residual smoke will carry-over into Friday morning, leading to some higher concentrations in the overnight hours.  At the same time, smoke from fires over Quebec, while diffuse compared to recent days with lower fine particle concentrations also noted at the surface under the plume will be funneled towards the Mid-Atlantic again on Friday.  Together this transported smoke and residual smoke will keep fine particle concentrations elevated Friday with USG forecast for the daily average.  Where rain occurs Friday, precipitation will scour fine particles from the atmosphere, greatly improving air quality locally.  A general cleaning trend will occur into Saturday, with Moderate air quality expected.  By Sunday, however, with sun and above average temperatures expected, ozone is expected to respond. Diffuse smoke may persist, but ozone will become the lead pollutant, pushing towards the Moderate/USG threshold.

Light winds overnight have slowed the southward progression of a thick plume of wildfire smoke through Pennsylvania that produced unhealthy levels of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) across the area on Wednesday.  This has led to concentrations during the overnight hours remaining more elevated but will improve a little bit during the day today.  *** Thursday's Forecast: For Thursday, expect the smoky conditions that have persisted over the past two days to continue to persist through much of the day.  The highest air quality levels are expected to occur during the morning hours, as the air mass that settled in Wednesday night continues to persist over our area.  Expect the air quality levels to decrease during the day thanks to a slight transition in the overall weather pattern.  The main low-pressure system over Nova Scotia will begin to retrograde (i.e. move from east to west) across the eastern Canada.  This westward movement will change the orientation of the winds over PA.  Model guidance indicates that the plume will actually shift further to the west, thus relaxing the onslaught of smoke over eastern PA.    Afternoon temperatures will stay slightly below normal, with highs in the low 70s.  Even with the declining levels of PM 2.5 expected, overall averages should at least remain well within the Code RED range. *** Extended Outlook: Over the coming days, expect the air quality to continue to improve in the near term as the overall weather continues to change from the one that impacted our weather over the past few days.  The area of low pressure, that began to back in over eastern Canada on Thursday, will finally move out over the next few days as a new storm system builds in from the Great Lakes region.  The movement of this storm system near our area will allow all of the smoke to retreat and allow the air quality (PM 2.5, primarily) to improve.  However, we could see ozone rise in advance of the frontal passage, as a result of increased sunshine allowing the photochemistry necessary for ozone production to occur.  The storm system will press through our area in the late Monday - early Tuesday time frame.  As it pushes through, expect some much need rain to provide some much-needed water to some very dry yards.  After an initial bump down, expect temperatures to rebound in the low to mid 80s by week's end as more of a zonal wind flow sets up over the area.  Overall, air quality levels could still remain elevated over the weekend.  The passage of the front though on Monday into Tuesday will provide some brief relief to air quality levels.  Air quality conditions will likely rise by week's end (not as high as what we are currently experiencing, thankfully!) as warmer temperatures move in. --Nolan/Roble|Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection

These conditions, combined with high pollutant carryover from the previous day, will lead to Unhealthy AQI levels for PM2.5.  Saturday, June 10 is anticipated to be a Code Orange Air Quality Action Day. Calm to light northwesterly winds early in the day will allow smoke to accumulate across the First State. Furthermore, sunny skies and highs in the low-80s will promote ozone development, while smoke will enhance ozone production. Therefore, despite strengthening west-northwesterly afternoon winds aiding dispersion, AQI levels are anticipated to be Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups for PM2.5.   Sunday, light and variable morning winds will allow pollutants to accumulate in Delaware. Additionally, partly sunny skies and highs near 90F will support ozone formation, while lingering smoke will enhance ozone production and keep particle levels elevated. However, winds will shift to southerly in the afternoon and evening, transporting a cleaner air mass into Delaware and resulting in high-Moderate AQI levels for ozone and PM2.5.|Delaware Dept. of Natural Resources and Environment

Light to moderate northwesterly winds will continue to transport dense smoke from Canadian wildfires into northeast Ohio, increasing particle concentrations. These conditions will cause AQI levels to be Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups on both days.  Saturday, light west-southwesterly winds will gradually push the highest concentrations of smoke east of Youngstown-Warren. However, regional carryover of smoke from the previous days will keep particle levels elevated through the morning hours. In addition, mostly sunny skies and warmer temperatures will enhance ozone production. As a result, AQI levels will be high-Moderate.
